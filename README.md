# Power-BI-Dashboard
**Overview** :
<br>
<br>
This is a sample Repository for Power BI Dashboard including steps to create it. I have created this using random data from internet and Tool for Power BI Dashboard.
<br>
<br>
**Steps to create it** :
- Firstly, whoever wants to create this dashboard need to have Power BI tool on their machine which you can download it from internet. It is very easy to install and the link is as below.
Click on this link (  https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-in/downloads/  ) then look for the option to download it. Click on the downloaded link and install on your computer.
- Next step is to open this tool and loadout your file from the option " Get Data " which is in home tab. I have provided excel file so you have to choose get data from Workbook.
After loading out file we have to analyse if the data is clean. If it is required then you can clean data and add or remove required columns from data set. This option is available in home tab and is called " Transform Data ".
- Later, for the tags like SALES, QUANTITY, AVERAGE DELIVERY DAYS and RETURNED OEDER I have used CARDS which is available in Visualisation. Next I have applied borders to them and Set out their colours.
For maping " Map " option is available. Add required fields to it.
Then for Segment and Market positioning I have used Pie Chart and Donut Chart. You can set visibility of data in those charts according to your preference. Here I have kept it minimal.
I have represented Top Customers through Column Chart, Profit and Loss by Stacked Bar Chart and again we can alter them according to our preference.
